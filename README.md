# tinyHalloween2019Platformer
A spooky little platformer that I want to finish a whole level for by the end of October for Halloween. Main features I want to implement are not to dissimilar to Super Mario Bros. 1

Using a script based on Brackey's 2d character controller script, with several modifcations and tweaks added.
Took the music from an older unity project, background made by @moodycoodies
