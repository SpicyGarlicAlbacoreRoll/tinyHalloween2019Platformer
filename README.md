# tinyHalloween2019Platformer
A spooky little platformer that I want to finish a whole level for by the end of October for Halloween. Main features I want to implement are not to dissimilar to Super Mario Bros. 1

Using a script based on Brackey's 2d character controller script, with several modifcations and tweaks added.
Took the music from an older unity project, background made by @moodycoodies

VERSIONS:

V.0.4.2 (Day 4)

    Got carried away messing with Unity's experimental 2D lighting

V.0.4.1 (Day 4)

    Edited the level further to make it more clear what safe falls look like
    If player falls out of bounds near the end of the stage they will get teleported back to the start

V.0.3.2 (Day 3)

    Added enemies
    Added jumping and bouncing off enemies
    Added enemy movement script

V.0.3.1 (Day 3)

    Added more level
    Music now loops

    Added walking animation
    Fixed being able to influence jump height after releasing and reholding jump button

Controls (Keyboard):

    A/D: Movement
    SPACEBAR: Jump (hold to influence jump height)
        (Note: being able to jump while being next to sides of a ground tile is a feature. 
        Some might call it a bug but I prefer to call it "vaulting" :sunglasses: )
    R: Reset position
